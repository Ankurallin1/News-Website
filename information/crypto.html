            Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.
        Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before the end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and households facing the energy crisis, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/italys-parliament-gives-final-approval-governments-2023-budget-2022-12-29/"> <span class="crypto">reported.</span></a> <br><br>
        Italy's (and most recently<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/10/portuguese-proposal-would-enact-taxes-on-crypto-transfers-capital-gains/"> <span class="crypto">Portugal's</span></a> ) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/04/eu-delays-vote-on-mica-crypto-legislation-until-february/"> <span class="crypto">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)</span></a>  regulation that promises a licensing frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.
        The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase. <br><br>
        According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried forward. <br><br>
        Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."
